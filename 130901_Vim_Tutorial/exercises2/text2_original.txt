Bram Moolenaar began working on Vim for the Amiga computer in 1988. 

Moolenaar first publicly released Vim (v1.14) in 1991.
Vim was based on an earlier editor, Stevie, for the Atari ST, created by Tim 
Thompson, Tony Andrews and G.R. (Fred) Walter.

The name "Vim" is an acronym for "Vi IMproved" because Vim is an extended 
version of the vi editor, with many additional features designed to be 
helpful in editing program source code. Originally, the acronym stood for "Vi 
IMitation", but that was changed with the release of Vim 2.0 in December 1993.

A later comment states that the reason for changing the name was that Vim's 
feature set surpassed that of vi.
