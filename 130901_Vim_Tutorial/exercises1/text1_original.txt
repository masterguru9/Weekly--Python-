Vim is a text editor written by Bram Moolenaar and first released publicly in 
1991. 

Based on the vi editor common to Unix-like systems, Vim is designed for use 
both from a command line interface and as a standalone application in a 
graphical user interface. Vim is free and open source software and is released 
under a license that includes some charityware clauses, encouraging users who 
enjoy the software to consider donating to children in Uganda. The license 
is compatible with the GNU General Public License.

Although Vim was originally released for the Amiga, Vim has since been 
developed to be cross-platform, supporting many other platforms. In 2006, it 
was voted the most popular editor amongst Linux Journal readers.
